cs361-GroupProject
==================

A selection of database syntax designed for use in MySQL to allow the recording of student scores on specific assessments and criteria.

Compilation of this project involves having a .NET 4.5 capable version of Visual Studio (developed mostly in 2012 or 2013).  From here you will need the MySQL data connector for Visual Studio (instructions here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/connector-net-visual-studio-install.html).
After that it should be as simple as using the normal build command.

As for the computer that runs the application it should only need .NET 4.5.  Though final testing was done with the MySQL adapter installed on the computer itself as well - though I don't believe MySQL intends it to be a requirement.
